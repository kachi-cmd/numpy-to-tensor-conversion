# numpy-to-tensor-conversion
Numpy to Tensor Conversion:: 

The project aimed to convert NumPy arrays into PyTorch tensors and subsequently perform NumPy-like operations on these tensors to demonstrate the similarities between the two APIs. Tensors are specialized data structures resembling arrays and matrices. In PyTorch, tensors are the foundation for encoding model inputs, outputs, and parameters. While arrays, numpys, and tensors share similarities, tensors offer additional capabilities, such as GPU acceleration, which are crucial for machine learning applications.
